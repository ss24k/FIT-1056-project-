Condiionals and loops

Empty Statement
The simplest statement is the empty statement i.e. a statement which does nothing.
In Python, the empty statement is the pass statement.
It is written as:
Whenever the interpreter encounters a pass statement, Python does nothing and
simply moves to the next statement in the flow of control. The pass statement is a
do nothing statement i.e. empty statement or a null operation statement.


Conditional Statement using if
The if statements are the conditional statements in Python that implement
selection constructs. If statement checks for a condition, if the condition
evaluates to true, a course of action is followed otherwise that course of action
is ignored but another course of action is followed.
The simplest form of if statement tests a condition and if the condition
evaluates to true, it carries out some instructions but does nothing if the
condition evaluates to false. where statement may be a single statement, a compound statement
or just a pass statement.

Programs
1. Write a Menu driven program to calculate the surface area and volume of a
cube, cuboid or sphere depending upon the userâ€™s choice.
2. Write a program to input a number. If it is an even number print its square
otherwise print its cube.
3. Write a program to input principal amount and time. If the time is more than
10 years, print the simple interest with a rate of 8% p.a. Otherwise print it
with 12 % p.a.
4. Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not. If a year is divisible by 4
then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it
must be divisible by 400.
